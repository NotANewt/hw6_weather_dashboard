## Usage

When the user visits the app, they are prompted to allow or block location information. If they allow it, they are presented with current and future weather conditions for their location. They can also search for a city in the form input. If they block location information, they can search for a city in the form input. When they search for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and the city name is added as a button to the search history. When they view current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When the user views the UV index, they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable (green), moderate (yellow), or severe (red). When they view future weather conditions for that city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
